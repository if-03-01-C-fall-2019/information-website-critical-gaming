            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>What we have already done</h3
            <p>As we said, we want to log our progress in this little section of the about us panel. We have already done the navigationbar whichis pretty good otherwise you wouldn't be here to read this. I am going to fill every tab with everything we are able to do in our state of prgramming talent which gave us our nice teacher. In the "HallOfFame" Panel there is now a table with some random rankings to show what we want to do. In the "Gaming" Tab we want to describe what gaming in general is.</p>
            <h3>The people working behind this Page</h3>
            <p>Hi! We are Balog Danijel and Romeo Bhuiyan who are working for this page. This projekt is alive becase in our school there is a teaching unit which is called Website technology (WEBT) where have to create our own Webpage with our own features. If we do our job well then I have the chance to present it infront of many peopleof our school and that is our goal. I hope we can reach it.</p>
            <h3>Our plannings for the future</h3>
            <p>The big future plannings are the "login" panel with some more options that the user feels more confortable on our website. The so called "dev" and "publisher" are really similar. There will be a list where all devs and publisher are listed and have some other options which we are planning. Also we want to use parallax scrolling for our Homepage that the whole thing gets a little smoother. In the "Games" Tab we want to putsome pictures of the games in it and put some information on the sides.</p>
            <h3>Idea behind this projekt</h3>
            <p>Our idea is that we can make a user-friendly webpage for all gamers and the people wo want to inform their selfs about gaming to understand the other people or even start to game on thier own. This page is here to make every person which likes gaming happy.</p>
