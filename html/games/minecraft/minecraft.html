      Minecraft, as if you've never heard of it, as if we haven't been telling you to play it for years, as if we
      didn't already give it Game of the Year in 2010, is a game about building things out of blocks with your
      friends.<br><br>
      The game world is rendered in cubes, every one of which can be destroyed, stored in your inventory, and placed
      back down anywhere you like. The map generates more terrain as you explore in a new direction, almost infinitely
      (you will run out of hard disk space at some point). That terrain is a quilt of discrete environmental regions,
      or biomes: as you travel, the thick forest you spawned in will give way to veldt or cliffs, or a desert peppered
      with cacti. You might reach the ocean, or a marsh clogged with exploding monsters and lily pads, or an ice floe
      leading to a wintry island.<br><br>
      Such random features as rivers, caves, waterfalls and ravines thread this world. Herds of friendly, blocky
      animals graze happily here and there: pigs, sheep, cows and chickens all provide useful products when
      slaughtered, and they can even be kept and bred.
