      <p class="gametext">
        You are Cal Kestis, a bland-faced scrapper with too-clean hair and an inexplicable love for ponchos. You are
        also probably the deadliest person in the universe. Though you spend your days cutting crashed Star Destroyers
        open for parts, within your cloak you hide the true star of Jedi: Fallen Order—a blue lightsaber that you will
        use to strike down hundreds of stormtroopers across the course of the game.
        <br>If you concentrate on main story missions, this is about a 20-hour adventure set across a cluster of themed
        planets. There's a red one, a green one, an ice one, and so on—common videogame fair. The story is set between
        the prequel trilogy of films and Episode 4: A New Hope, after the Sith has enacted Order 66 and turned the
        Republic's clone army against the Jedi. Cal's mission, once he realises he should probably get off the junk
        planet and follow his destiny, is to seize a 'holocron' data cache that contains a grand list of every
        force-sensitive child in the galaxy. Agents of the dark side are after it too, of course, and so begins a
        breezy, entertaining third-person action adventure with a fantastic lightsaber.
        <br>It's one of the best weapons in fiction, and Respawn has done a great job of emulating the look and feel of
        the
        Jedi's signature weapon. It cracks to life when you press left on the D-pad. You can combo together light
        strikes by
        tapping the square/X button, and activate special attacks with the triangle/Y button. You hold left bumper to
        block
        incoming blaster fire and most enemy melee attacks. If you time your left bumper press well, you can parry
        enemies
        and send blaster fire hurtling right back at the trooper shooting you.
