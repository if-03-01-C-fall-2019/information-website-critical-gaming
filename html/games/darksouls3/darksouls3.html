      <br>I'm friends with a giant now. He tosses spears taller than me a thousand yards off towards a white birch. He
      wants to keep it safe from cursed villagers, and I can respect that. From up here the tree is a speck of brilliant
      white in sickly olive and grey. We stand together in silence for a while. The whole village is visible from atop
      his tower, all its ramshackle buildings and tortured denizens whose worship of a rotten greatwood has clearly gone
      awry. I can almost smell the mold. My job is to bring the ashes of the treasonous Lords of Cinder back to their
      thrones to prevent the apocalypse. Maybe it’d be better off that way. This world isn’t my friend.
      <br>But this giant is, and if he cares about a little white tree, then I should too. That might be reason enough
      to keep this rotten place together.
      <br>This is what makes Dark Souls 3 so profound. Sure, the thrilling, punishing combat and notoriously difficult
      boss battles are its titanium skeleton, but the language and ambiguity of the world are its flesh and blood—the
      beating heart that imbues an excellent third-person action RPG with mythic authenticity. Marred only by few
      performance hiccups, Dark Souls 3 is one of the most engrossing, cohesive games I’ve ever played, and the most
      focused, potent game in the series.
      <br>Like it’s predecessors, Dark Souls 3 is an eerie Japanese spin on western fantasy that tells a surreal story
      in broad, vague strokes. You still kill monsters, collect souls, and use them to level up a short list of primary
      stats. Dying means you lose your souls and respawn at the bonfire you last rested at. Run back to pick them up and
      carry on, hopefully further this time, but die before reaching them and they’re gone for good. It’s a harsh system
      that blankets every foray into new territory with uncertainty and tension. I spent most of the game with my shield
      up, tip-toeing.
